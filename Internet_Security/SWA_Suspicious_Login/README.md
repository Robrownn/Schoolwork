# Modified SWA APP - Suspcious Login Attempt Logging

This assignment is a modification of the previous iteration of our Secure Web App that allows for logging of suspicious login attempts and prevents account hacking.

## Changes to be Made
* Add logout button
	1. Destroy session on click
	2. Modify Login page to redirect to home page if already logged in

* Modify Database tables for logging failed attempts

* Modify PHP scripts to interact with database to log failed attempts and perform lockouts on too many failed attempts.
